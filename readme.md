## What is Autonomous Education?

Technology advances very quickly. This project aims to provide a method of learning programming which is not bound to any content. Autonomous Education refers to both the autonomy of the learner, and also the autonomy of the tech ecosystem. Students are given freedom to use technology to build what they want. The tech ecosystem will grow on its own, as new technologies emerge.  Even as new technologies enter the landscape every day, we can stay up to date if we donâ€™t point to specific resources, and instead stick to the process.

The more freedom a learner has, the more engaged they will be. They will take ownership of their education, as it helps them toward their goals. Learners who have made their own decisions and discoveries are also more likely to share thoughts and experiences with their peers. This can be done in a classroom, or by sharing on the internet. This act of sharing reinforces knowledge and allows for metacognition. At this point, it comes full-circle and those who learned now feed their knowledge back into the ecosystem.
