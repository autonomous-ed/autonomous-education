# Autonomous Education

### If you want to teach yourself to code you are in the right place!

This framework provides tools for learning any technology. This is possible because the learning process is essentially guided by a [cycle](documents/cycle) that is the same regardless of which technology you are learning. The initial action is referred to as the [kickstart](documents/kickstart) because it gets the [cycle](documents/cycle) started. After your initial input, the technology you are using will produce some form of feedback. This feedback is often an [error](documents/errors). The feedback can then be researched, and influence the next iteration.

This framework was designed with a few features in mind. Firstly, there are no assumptions about which technologies a user may be learning. This protects the system from obsolescence, because over time even though technologies may come and go, the learning process does not change significantly from year to year.

### "uhh, cool. Where do I start?"

What is the **smallest** unit of functionality required to achieve your goal?

If you were making tinder for rescued puppies (maybe named _hot doggo_? :dog: ), you might start with enabling animal shelter volunteers to upload pictures of the puppers with their smart phones, and saving them somewhere so anyone can browse them.

We are pretty sure about 2 things at this point, we want to make an app, and it needs access to the camera.

You could start with a Google search like `how to make app with camera`

That is just the very first piece of the app, but we have to start somewhere!

We call that the [kickstart](documents/kickstart)!
