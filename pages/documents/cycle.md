# The Cycle

The cycle is the feedback loop that guides your learning. It starts with an action as an input, the technology will then return feedback.

Often the feedback comes in the form of an [error](errors). Whatever form the feedback takes it can be researched, and influence your next action. In this way, learning programming is a rigourous process of trial and error.

This cycle continues until the system has reached the desired state, or in other words: until you are satisfied with what you've built.
