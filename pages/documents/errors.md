# Errors

One of the greatest attributes of computers is that they will always tell you exactly what went wrong. Often the error messages you get when writing code are foreign and confusing. In times like these it can be helpful to just copy/paste it into google, and see what other developers have done to resolve the issue.

Don't feel bad about seeing errors!
