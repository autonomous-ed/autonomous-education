# Toolset

The following is a list of tools that can help when learning a new technology.

**Search**

When using a search engine, it is generally a good idea to have as few words as possible, while still being specific,
It may be useful to limit your search to recent history to ensure relevant and accurate information


**Evaluating information**

The first place to look should be the website of the technology you are trying to use, if you must look elsewhere do not click on ads, and check how many people gave positive ratings to the documents you read


**Do it wrong**

Build something that works, optimize later


**Rubber duck**

Talk your problem through with an inanimate object, problems are solved frequently just by talking them through


**Sleep**

It is extremely important to get rest in terms of health, but also works wonders when problem-solving


**Fresh eyes**

Taking a break can help solve a problem by providing a fresh perspective


**Peer review**

Sometimes a friend will provide a fresh perspective, and sometimes they can spot problems that you are overlooking


**Stack overflow**

Look for answers to your problems on StackOverflow, you will rarely need to ask a question


**One change at a time**

When debugging try just changing one thing at a time, this will often indicate which parts are not working as expected


**Break points**

Examine state by pausing execution of code, and looking at the variables


**Log a lot**

When learning it is useful to know the values of variables, which functions are being called etc, log values and checkpoints


**Minimise time spent refreshing**

Live-reload and other technologies enable changing code on the fly. This is huge for saving time, allowing to make changes and immediately seeing the result


**Let me google that for you**

A great and silly tool to shame peers into solving problems on their own
